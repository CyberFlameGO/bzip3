# BZip3

A harder, better, faster and stronger spiritual successor to BZip2. Features higher compression ratios and better performance thanks to a order-2 context mixing entropy coder and fast Burrows-Wheeler transform code making use of suffix arrays.

Work-In-Progress. For the time being, don't expect the trunk to be compatible with previous commits.
